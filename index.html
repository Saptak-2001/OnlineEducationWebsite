        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">iEducate is changing the usual learning experience. It has become the new standard way of learning and is highly beneficial to high school and college students due to its flexibility, low cost, and user experience. The challenge as we see it is two-fold: first, achievement gaps for students in elementary school lead to greater gaps in education attainment in secondary school and beyond. Second, fewer people are choosing professional education pathways, leading to teacher shortages that impact student learning. iEducate addresses both challenges by taking admission of high school and college students who provide individualized support to classrooms, while also providing a homegrown talent pipeline for schools in Kolkata.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">1. We partner with districts to recruit, train and support high school and college tutors to work alongside certified teachers in the classroom. <br><br> 
        2. Tutors provide one-on-one and small group support to students to help improve education outcomes for at-risk students. <br><br>
        3. Beyond helping improve student learning, tutors gain early exposure to the teaching profession, helping them identify and explore career paths in education.</p>
